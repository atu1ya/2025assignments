def trains_planes(trains, planes):
    """Find what flights can be replaced with a rail journey.

    Initially, there are no rail connections between cities. As rail connections
    become available, we are interested in knowing what flights can be replaced
    by a rail journey, no matter how indirect the route. All rail connections
    are bidirectional.

    Target Complexity: O(N lg N) in the size of the input (trains + planes).

    Args:
        trains: A list of `(date, lcity, rcity)` tuples specifying that a rail
            connection between `lcity` and `rcity` became available on `date`.
        planes: A list of `(code, date, depart, arrive)` tuples specifying that
            there is a flight scheduled from `depart` to `arrive` on `date` with
            flight number `code`.

    Returns:
        A list of flights that could be replaced by a train journey.
